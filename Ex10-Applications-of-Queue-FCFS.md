## DATE:14.5.25
## AIM:
To write a C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm.
## Algorithm
1.	Start with process, burst time, and waiting time arrays.
2.	Loopthrough each process from i= 0 to n-1.
3.	Compute tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i].
4.	End the algorithm.   
 

## Program:
```

Program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression

*/
/*#include <stdio.h>*/
  int avgtime( int proc[], int n, int burst_time[]) {
   int wait_time[n], tat[n], total_wt = 0, total_tat = 0;
   int i;
   //type your code here...
   waitingtime(proc,n,burst_time,wait_time);
   turnaroundtime(proc,n,burst_time,wait_time,tat);
   printf("Processes  Burst   Waiting  Turn around\n");
   for(i=0;i<n;i++)
   {
       total_wt+=wait_time[i];
       total_tat+=tat[i];
       printf(" %d\t\t   %d\t\t    %d\t\t   %d\n",i+1,burst_time[i],wait_time[i],tat[i]);
   }
   printf("Average waiting time = %f\n",(float)total_wt/(float)n);
   printf("Average turn around time = %f\n",(float)total_tat/(float)n);
   return 0;
}
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus, the C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm is implemented successfully.
